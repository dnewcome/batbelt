instructions to deploy a new tool:

Download the plain zip installation of a utility, or extract the files from 
the installer and place in a folder under batbelt. Preferably the folder will have
an 'unfriendly' name, that is, should include version number and platform 
as indicated eg,

Filezilla-3.4.0_win32

note that the executable will be relative to this folder.

deploying to the remote server-
edit the config.bat file to point to the remote server via ssh first.

run:
deploy-tool.bat path\Folder-2.3_win32 Folder-2.3_win32

for example. .Yes the second arg is pretty much redundant, but string ops are 
a pain in batch files.
